# Synthetic Dataset Generator (Hindi)

Synthetically create a dataset of images of Devanagari text drawn on images

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.5 and above
- PIL (Image)

You will also need to install Pillowâ€™s require external library "libraqm" before you run the code.
"libraqm" enables PIL to draw complex fonts like Devanagari on images correctly.
