# Synthetic Dataset Generator (Hindi)

Synthetically create a dataset of images of Devanagari text drawn on images

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.5 and above
- PIL (Image)
- numpy
- matplotlib

**You will also need to install Pillowâ€™s require external libraries before you run the code.
The libraries enables PIL to draw complex fonts like Devanagari on images correctly.**

Follow the steps on Pillow's Installation page to install libraries correctly, depending on what system you are using: https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html

**How to run script:**
```
python3 Generator.py "dataset_size" -lv -v -mt
```

Use the following args for the following use:

-  dataset_size   ->   Number of Images to generate

-  -h, --help   ->   Show this help message and exit
  
-  -lv, --large_vocab   ->   Use Large Vocab, Default is Small Vocab
  
-  -v, --verbose   ->   (Verbose) Display progress of generation
  
-  -mt, --multithreading   ->   Use multithreading


You have an option to choose between 2 vocab files, `Large_vocab_file.txt` and `Small_vocab_file.txt`.
Large vocab consists of 208162 hindi words. Small vocab consists of 9948 hindi words.


This will create "dataset_size" images in the directory `/Images`, with random backgrounds chosen from the `/Backgrounds` folder and a random word form the vocab file you choose.
