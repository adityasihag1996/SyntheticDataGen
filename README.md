# Synthetic Dataset Generator

## Overview
This project provides a tool for generating a synthetic dataset of images with text overlay. It is designed to create images with random words from either a small or large vocabulary, placed on a variety of background images and using different font styles. This dataset can be useful for various computer vision and machine learning tasks such as OCR (Optical Character Recognition), text detection, and more.

## Features
- Generation of custom-sized datasets.
- Selection between small and large vocabularies.
- Use of custom background images and fonts.
- Output images and ground truth data stored neatly in designated directories.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have installed the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
